            Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 – December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced
            "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter[3] from Chicago,
            Illinois. His 2018 single "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform Spotify over one
            billion times and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. "Lucid Dreams", along with his earlier hit
            single "All Girls Are the Same", helped him secure a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions
            and Interscope Records. He derived his stage name from late American rapper Tupac Shakur's role in the film
            Juice and stated that it represents taking over the world.[4] He is considered as a leading figure in the
            emo-rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-late 2010s.[5]

            <br>
            <br>"All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were two of five singles included on Higgins' debut studio
            album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry
            Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical reception, and contained three other
            singles: "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Hot 100. After
            collaborating with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), Higgins released his second studio album
            Death Race for Love (2019) alongside the singles "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling"; Death Race for Love
            debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming the artist's first album to top the chart.

            <br>
            <br>
            Higgins died following a drug overdose at Chicago's Midway International Airport. His first posthumous
            album, Legends Never Die (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was the most
            successful posthumous chart debut in over 20 years and matched a record for the most top-ten song entries on
            the Hot 100 at one time. The album's fourth single "Come & Go" with Marshmello became Higgins' second song
            to reach number two on the Hot 100 after "Lucid Dreams".
